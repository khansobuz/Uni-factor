# Uni-factor
Palmprint recognition systems stand as reliable 
solutions for their accuracy and affordability, yet safeguarding 
sensitive data remains a critical challenge. Conventional 
protection methods relying on keys or tokens are vulnerable to 
theft, necessitating innovative solutions. In response, we present a 
Uni-factor scheme for cancelable template protection utilizing 
deep sight networks and an improved bloom filter. In our 
proposed scheme, we first enhance recognition accuracy by 
leveraging the deep sight network mechanism in the model. 
Secondly, we introduce a privacy-preserving feature mapping 
technique to bolster security and privacy. Thirdly, we integrate a 
randomized quantization binary feature layer to convert 
palmprint features into binary code, enabling fast retrieval 
accuracy and greater efficiency. Finally, to ensure data 
encryption, we employ a random key matrix XOR operation with 
the quantization binary feature, storing the resulting encrypted 
data in the database. Moreover, the scheme implemented an 
improved bloom filter to generate a cancelable palmprint 
template, effectively addressing the issue of hash conflicts and 
thereby improving system performance. Thorough validation on 
prominent palmprint datasets such as TJU and PolyU, alongside 
an examination of the current state-of-the-art, establishes it as a 
solution with remarkable recognition performance. This 
comprehensive evaluation underscores the scheme's efficacy 
across various security and privacy metrics, highlighting its 
resilience against diverse attack scenarios
